📚 BrightMind Tutorial Hub — Educational Website (Sample Project)

BrightMind Tutorial Hub is a fictional website I created to represent a modern tutorial center offering academic support for students. It’s a static, fully responsive one-page website built to showcase services, build trust with parents and learners, and reflect a calm, focused learning environment.

🧠 About the Project

This project simulates what a real-life tutoring center might need from a simple website — clear presentation of services, an approachable tone, and easy navigation. It helped me sharpen my skills in layout structuring, responsive design, and styling websites for educational businesses.
